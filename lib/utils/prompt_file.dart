  static String textPrompt = 'Create a Flutter screen with a solid black background and manually animated glowing dots that float smoothly across the screen. At first, only a centered “Press Me” button should appear. When pressed, the button should fade out gracefully, and the name “Iqra Ilyas” should appear in a beautiful animated way — either typing or glowing using shimmer effects. The animation must feel smooth and soft, using AnimatedOpacity or FadeTransition to blend transitions naturally. Avoid using any external particle packages; build the glowing dots manually. Use the Poppins font from Google Fonts and make sure the overall layout feels professional, minimal, and responsive.';
  static String codePrompt = 'Build a Flutter screen that feels futuristic and creative. Start with a clean black background and a single “Press Me” button centered on the screen. When the user presses the button, it should smoothly disappear using a fade animation, and then reveal the name “Iqra Ilyas” with a glowing, modern text animation that subtly expands or fades in. Use animation widgets like AnimatedOpacity, AnimatedScale, and TweenAnimationBuilder to make the reveal elegant and engaging. The text should have a pulsing neon glow or shadow that feels alive. Keep the design minimal, modern, and typography-driven using Google Fonts Poppins.';
  static String advanceUiPrompt = 'Create a complete Flutter recipe app with a get started screen, home screen, recipe details screen, and profile screen. The get started screen should have a full background food image using a Stack layout, with the text “Let’s Cook with Heart ❤️” and a subtitle describing the idea, followed by a Get Started button that navigates to the main app. The home screen should start with a greeting section showing “Hello, Iqra 👋” on the left and a circular avatar on the right, followed by a search bar, then a horizontal category list like Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Special Meals. Below that, add a horizontal scrollable list of recipe cards showing real food images (from the network), and overlay a blurred container displaying the name, price, and rating. Handle image errors gracefully by showing a default icon if an image fails to load. Below this, include an “Ingredients” section with a “View All” link and a horizontal scrollable list of ingredient icons with their names. Then, add a “Top Chefs” section with a vertical list showing each chef’s photo, name, and area of expertise. Include a bottom navigation bar with three screens — Home, Details, and Profile. The Details screen should show the selected recipe’s full image, name, rating, and description. The Profile screen should display a user avatar, name, email, and a scrollable list of sections like Liked Recipes, My Recipes, Top Recipes, Favorites, and Shared Recipes. Use Poppins font, dummy data, and ensure the UI is responsive, scrollable, and visually realistic, maintaining a modern and professional style throughout.';
